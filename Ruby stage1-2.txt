# This is a single line comment in Ruby

=begin
This is a multiline comment in Ruby.
I can take as many lines as needed.
You end a multi-line comment in Ruby by typing:(see below)
=end

=begin
puts in Ruby is like the print or println command EXCEPT
it starts a new line after any puts statement.
=end

#myVar declares a variable
myVar = 48

my_num = 2+3
puts my_num 

# The code above will print out 5

# .length prints the number of characters in the string
myVar = "Karen Michelle Elizabeth Currie".length
puts myVar
# When you click Run it states 31

=begin
This is good for checking that a bank card entry
has the correct amount of digits.
=end

#.reverse is similar to .length but is prints out everything backwards
myVar = "Karen Michelle Elizabeth Currie".reverse
puts myVar

myVar = "Karen Muller".upcase
puts myVar
#prints in ALL CAPS

myVar = "Karen Muller".downcase
puts myVar
#prints in lowercase.


#Ruby code - please individualise

print "What's your first name? "
first_name = gets.chomp #gets asks for input from the user and starts a new line.
#.chomp takes away that extra blank line.

state.upcase!
